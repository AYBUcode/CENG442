# Take-Home Final Exam for CENG442: Text Summarization Using Seq2Seq Models

## Topic:
Developing a Text Summarization System for News Articles Using Seq2Seq Models with TensorFlow

---

## Objective:
Students will implement a Seq2Seq model with attention for summarizing news articles. The project will involve dataset preparation, model development, evaluation, and submission of a report, code, and a short video presentation.
The dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SgsCORTz5seRiuBLQefmr-MNeH9SuN7s/view?usp=sharing

## Instructions:

### Dataset:
- You will be provided with a dataset in Parquet format containing news articles and their summaries.
- **Reading the Dataset:** Use the following code snippet to load the dataset:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    # Read the Parquet file
    df = pd.read_parquet('file_path.parquet')

    # Display the DataFrame
    print(df)
    ```
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Suggested split: 80% training, 10% validation, 10% testing.

---

### Tasks:

#### 1. Preprocessing:
- Tokenize the text data and convert it to sequences using TensorFlow/Keras Tokenizer.
- Pad or truncate sequences to ensure uniform input length.
- Handle special tokens (e.g., start-of-sequence `<sos>` and end-of-sequence `<eos>`).

#### 2. Model Development:
- Build a Seq2Seq model in TensorFlow with the following components:
  - Encoder (RNN/LSTM/GRU).
  - Decoder with attention mechanism.
  - Attention layer to enhance summary quality.

#### 3. Training:
- Train the model on the training set, monitor performance using the validation set, and adjust hyperparameters as necessary.

#### 4. Evaluation:
- Use the test set to generate summaries.
- Evaluate the generated summaries using the ROUGE metric.

#### 5. Analysis:
- Compare generated summaries to reference summaries and discuss performance.
- Suggest potential improvements or extensions for better results.
